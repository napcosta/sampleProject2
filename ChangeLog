* Hacked around with configure.in and Makefile.am to
  try and make them portable across versions of
  autoconf/automake. Failed, and set the required autoconf
  to 2.57 instead.
* Removed GNU Pth derived thread contexts; replaced with
  assembly to switch stacks on i386 and PowerPC.
* Made use of native pthreads a compile time, instead of
  run time, option. Some pthreads libraries expect a
  pthread record at the base of the stack, even if the
  pthreads have not been initialized. This breaks
  the user-level threads.
* Bumped version to 1.10.
